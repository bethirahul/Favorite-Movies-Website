# Favorite-Movies-Website

Made by **Rahul Bethi**  
Made with Python 3.6.4 _(compatible with 2.7)_

This is a python project created as a part of Udacity - Full Stack Development Nanodegree.

To run the project:
* Run create_website.py using Python. This will create a HTML file called **fresh_tomatoes.html**
* Open **fresh_tomatoes.html**

The website created contains 9 of my favorite movies with name and box art. Clicking each one of them will open the trailer  
of that movie.
